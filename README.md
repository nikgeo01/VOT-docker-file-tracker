#File Usage Tracker App Setup Commands ##Here are the commands to set up and run the File Usage Tracker App containers:

###Clone the Repository:

'git clone https://github.com/nikgeo01/file-usage-tracker.git'

###Navigate to the Project Directory:

'cd file-usage-tracker'

###Build and Start the Docker Containers:

'docker-compose up --build'


# File Usage Tracker

The **File Usage Tracker** is an application designed to monitor file usage across different users and projects. It records user activities, such as the files they work on, the time spent on each file, and the applications used. The collected data is stored in CSV files and imported into a PostgreSQL database for report generation.

This project includes:
- A **tracking application** that logs user activities to CSV files (existing code, unchanged).
- A **report generator** that reads data from a PostgreSQL database and generates reports.
- Docker containers for the **PostgreSQL database** and the **report generator application**.
- Scripts and configurations to set up and run the application using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/nikgeo01/file_usage_tracker.git`

Navigate to the project directory:

`cd file_usage_tracker`

### 2. Set Up the Containers

(OPTIONAL) Gather own information by runnning
(OPTIONAL) `python ./src/main.py`(WINDOWS ONLY)

Use Docker Compose to start the PostgreSQL database container:

`docker-compose up --build`

## Application Overview

### Tracking Application

- **Purpose**: Monitors and records user activities such as file usage, time spent, and applications used.
- **Data Storage**: Writes data to CSV files in the `yearly_reports/` directory (existing functionality, unchanged).
- **Note**: The tracking application is not containerized and runs independently.

### Report Generator

- **Purpose**: Generates reports based on the data collected by the tracking application.
- **Data Source**: Reads data from a PostgreSQL database.
- **Functionality**:
  - Imports data from CSV files (copies of the tracking application's CSV files) located in the `db/` directory.
  - Provides a GUI for users to generate reports.
- **Containerization**: Optionally containerized using Docker (GUI applications have limitations in containers).

## Additional Notes

- **Database Persistence**:
  - The PostgreSQL database uses a Docker volume (`db_data`) to persist data between restarts.
  - The volume is defined in `docker-compose.yml` and stored on your local machine.

- **Running the Report Generator in Docker**:
  - Running GUI applications inside Docker containers requires additional configuration and is generally not recommended.
  - If necessary, consider using technologies like X11 forwarding or running a VNC server inside the container.

- **Data Source**:
  - The `db/` directory contains copies of the CSV files generated by the tracking application.
  - Ensure the CSV files are up-to-date before running the import script.

- **Extending the Application**:
  - Modify the tracking application to write directly to the database instead of CSV files for a more integrated solution.
  - Implement a web-based interface for the report generator to facilitate containerization and remote access.
